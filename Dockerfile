# Adds the default Ubuntu uid(1000) to the www-data user. This is so
# both of the uid's  on the host and the container match. The www-data user
# is used by Apache to make directory/file level changes.
#
#
# It also grants ownership to the /var/www folder to the www-data user. 
# All new files and subdirectories in the www/ folder will inherit the group id # of the www/ directory.
